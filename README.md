# What?
Welcome to ts pmo, an AI assistant to let users convert between cryptocurrencies with ease.
We built our agent to automate the briding and swapping process, and optimised for gas efficiency.

# Who?
This was made by three Imperial first-year students (and a little GenAI) as part of ETH Oxford 25.

# When?
In 48 hours, we created this app. From the inception of our idea to now in just one short weekend!

# Where?
We were fortunate to have access to the facilities at the Oxford Maths Department for the weekend, thank you ETH!

# Why?
We were inspired by the Avalanche main track at ETH Oxford 2025, which had the title: "AI Agents for DeFi & Cross-Chain Operations"

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
